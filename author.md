I am [Dhaval Kapil](https://dhavalkapil.com/), also known as 'vampire'. I am a software security enthusiast, always reading up or trying to find vulnerabilities in everyday software. I'll be graduating from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)(IIT Roorkee) in Computer Science this year. I was part of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/), where I developed [BackdoorCTF](http://backdoor.sdslabs.co/). I'll be joining [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) as a Master's student this fall. Software development is my hobby and I've also completed the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program twice. Find me on [Github](https://github.com/dhavalkapil) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dhaval_kapil).

This book started out as an article for my [blog](https://dhavalkapil.com/). Eventually, a lot of matter filled in and it transformed into a short book. These are a collection of my notes, gathered by looking up various resources online regarding heap and heap exploitation.
