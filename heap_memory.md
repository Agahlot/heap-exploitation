# Heap memory

## What is Heap?

Heap is a memory region alloted to every program. Unlike stack, heap memory can be dynamically allocated. This means that the program can 'request' and 'release' memory from the heap segment as and when it requires. Also, this memory is global, i.e. it can be accessed and modified from anywhere within a program and is not localised to the function where it is allocated. This is accomplished using 'pointers' to reference dynamically allocated memory which in turn leads to a small _degradation_ in performance as compared to using local variables(on the stack).
