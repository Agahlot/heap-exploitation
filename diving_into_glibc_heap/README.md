# Diving into glibc heap

In this section, implementation of glibc's heap management functions will be discussed in depth. The analysis was done on glibc's source code dated [27th March, 2017](http://repo.or.cz/glibc.git/tree/17f487b7afa7cd6c316040f3e6c86dc96b2eec30). The source is very well documented.

Apart from the source code, the matter presented is influenced by:

* [Understanding glibc malloc](https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/)
* [Understanding the heap by breaking it](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Ferguson/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-ferguson-WP.pdf)
