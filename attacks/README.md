# Heap Exploitation

The `glibc` library provides functions such as `free` and `malloc` to help developers manage the heap memory according to their use cases. It is the responsibility of the developer to:

* `free` any memory he/she has obtained using `malloc`.
* Do not `free` the same memory 'twice'.

Failing to do makes the software vulnerable to various kinds of attacks.
