# Heap Exploitation

The `glibc` library provides functions such as `free` and `malloc` to help developers manage the heap memory according to their use cases. It is the responsibility of the developer to:

* `free` any memory he/she has obtained using `malloc`.
* Do not `free` the same memory more than once.
* Ensure that memory usage does not go beyond the amount of memory requested, in other terms, prevent heap overflows.

Failing to do makes the software vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. [Shellphish](https://twitter.com/shellphish), a famous Capture the Flag team from UC Santa Barbara, has done a great job in listing a variety of heap exploitation techniques in [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap). Attacks described in "The Malloc Maleficarum" by "Phantasmal Phantasmagoria" in an [email](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2005/Oct/118) to the "Bugtraq" mailing list are also described.
